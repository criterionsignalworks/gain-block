# Overview

CS Gain Block (CSGB) is a very economical HMC313 based RF amplifier module with on board power regulation and a nice "cutting edge RF black magic" aesthetic thanks to the inverted soldermask. 

It has about 10 dB of gain, and is good from near DC to 6 or 7 GHz. (These are figures from characterization with VNA, see more details below.) 

We developed this as part of our exploration into radars, [Project Mashiro](https://github.com/criterionsignalworks/mashiro).
